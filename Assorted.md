## Generics
- Generics enable developer to write flexible and reusable functions that can work with any type
- Advantages are `optimization` and `reusability`
- In swift, arrays and dictionaries are generics
- Example - Array of Int / Array of Strings
  
## Synthesize-Dynamic
|Synthesize|Dynamic|
|-|-|
|It will generate setter and getter methods for the property|It will tell compiler that setter and getter are implemented somewhere in the super class|

## Frame-Bound
|Frame|Bound|
|-|-|
|Defines the position and size of a view within its superview's coordinate system|Defines the position and size of a view's content or subviews within the view's own coordinate system|

## Any-AnyObject
- Any is for Value or Reference type
- Anyobject is for only reference type
  
## AccessibilityLabel and AccessibilityIdentifier
- Lable is used for Screen reading (Voice Over)
- Id is used for identifying UI elements for UI testing

## Dynaminc vs Static Dispatch
- Static dispatch, also known as `early binding`, occurs at compile time.
- Dynamic dispatch, also known as `late binding`, occurs at runtime.

## Dynamic vs Static Libraries
- A static library is compiled and linked with the application code at compile time.
- A dynamic library is compiled separately from the application and linked at runtime.

## Stack vs Heap
  |Stack|Heap|
  |-|-|
  |Used for `static memory` allocation|Used for `dynamic memory` allocation|
  |Value types are stored in stack|Reference types are stored in heap|
  |Allocation happens during compile time|Allocation happens during runtime|
  |LIFO||
  
## Access Modifiers
  - Final: Cannot override and subclass
  - Public: Only visisble outside module, cant override or subclass 
  - Open: Not only visible outside of module, we can override and subclass
  - Private: Visible only enclosing declerations and in the extension of same source file
  - FilePrivate: Visible only in the declared source file
  - Internal: default access level, visible in the same module

## lazy keyword
  - A lazy var is a property whose initial value is not calculated until the first time itâ€™s called.
  - If it's never called, the var/function is never run, so it does help save processing time and memory.
    
## static keyword
  - We can directly access the static properties and methods of a class with help of class itself `instead of creating the instance of the class`.
    
## defer keyword
  - The code inside the defer block will be executed just before the function returns.
  - When you use multiple defer statements, the code within each defer block will be executed in reverse order of their appearance
    ```
    func exampleFunction() {
    print("Start")

    defer {
        print("First defer")
    }

    defer {
        print("Second defer")
    }

    print("End")
    }
    
    exampleFunction()

    // Output
    Start
    End
    Second defer
    First defer
    ```
    
## mutating func
  - Value types, such as structs and enums, are immutable by default, meaning their properties cannot be changed within methods.
  - `mutating` keyword is used to declare methods within a structure (value type) or an enumeration (enum) <b>that modify the instance itself</b>
  ```
  struct Stack<Element> {
    private var elements = [Element]()

    // Push an element onto the stack
    mutating func push(_ element: Element) {
        elements.append(element)
    }

    // Pop the top element from the stack
    mutating func pop() -> Element? {
        return elements.popLast()
    }

    // Peek at the top element without removing it
    func peek() -> Element? {
        return elements.last
    }

    // Check if the stack is empty
    var isEmpty: Bool {
        return elements.isEmpty
    }

    // Get the number of elements in the stack
    var count: Int {
        return elements.count
    }
  }

  // Example usage:
  var myStack = Stack<Int>()
  
  myStack.push(1)
  myStack.push(2)
  myStack.push(3)
  ```

# Misc
## SSH-Pinning
  - iOS app ensures a secure connection to a specific SSH server by "pinning" or validating the server's SSH key fingerprint
  - Avoid middle man attacks
  - Private Key Pinning - Client will use same private key as server
  - Certificate Pinning - Client will use the same certificate of server. Developer must keep updating the certificates depending on expiry dates
